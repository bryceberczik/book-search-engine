## Description
The Book Search Engine is a robust web application designed for book lovers who want an easy and intuitive way to explore and manage their favorite reads. Leveraging the MERN stack—MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js—the app offers a seamless experience, enabling users to search for books, save their favorites, and customize their reading lists. Powered by the Google Books API, the application provides access to a vast library of titles, allowing users to discover a wide variety of books across genres and authors. Users can create accounts to securely log in, save their favorite books, and effortlessly manage their collections by adding or removing titles from their saved list, all within a streamlined and user-friendly interface.
